# dsmr-p1-parser
Ragel-based C-parser for Dutch Smart Meter P1-data

Author: Levien van Zon (levien at gnuritas.org)

## DSMR P1

DSMR (Dutch Smart Meter Requirements) is a standard for "smart" utility meters used in The Netherlands. Meters that comply with DSMR have several interfaces, including:

   - P1, a send-only serial interface that can be used to connect local devices to an electricity meter. The connected devices can receive data from the electricity meter and its slave devices.
   - P2, an [M-bus](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Meter-Bus) interface used for communication between utility meters (e.g. a gas meter, a water meter and an electricity meter, whereby the electricity meter acts as a master and the other meters as slaves). 
   - P3, an infrastructure to periodically send aggregated meter data from an electricity meter to a central server, using a cellular modem (GPRS, CDMA or LTE), ethernet or power-line communication (PLC). Data is generally sent at most once per day, aggregated at 10-minute intervals, for a subset of variables.  
   - P4, which is strictly speaking not an interface at the meter level, but a standard for storing data on and retrieving data from a central server architecture.

In addition to the above interfaces, most DSMR-meters also have additional interfaces, such as an optical [IEC 62056-21](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/IEC_62056#IEC_62056-21) serial interface and an S0 (DIN 43864) pulse-output (which is usually not accessible, unfortunately).

Several versions of the official DSMR P1 standard are included in the `doc/` directory of this repository. Also included there are [notes on the broader IEC 62056-21 standard](doc/IEC-62056-21-notes.md), on which the P1-standard is based.  


## The Parser

This repository contains a parser for DSMR data-telegrams, based on the [Ragel state machine compiler](http://www.colm.net/open-source/ragel/), as well as the DSMR P1 specification documents (in `doc/`) and an example program in C for reading and parsing DSMR-data from a serial port in Linux (on any other POSIX system such as BSD or MacOS). To compile the Ragel parser and the example program, you need to install the [Ragel](http://www.colm.net/open-source/ragel/) state machine compiler (on Debian, Ubuntu and derivatives, simply do: `sudo apt-get install ragel`, on other systems you can `git clone git://colm.net/ragel.git`) and run `./make.sh`. In principle this parser can also be adapted for use on microcontrollers, although I haven't tried this yet. 

In addition to DSMR P1-telegrams, the parser can handle more general IEC 62056-21 telegram data, albeit with a very limited set of OBIS-objects, so that it can be used to obtain energy readings from many non-DSMR smart meters through the optical port. The parser has been tested with example data from all currently known versions of DSMR (2.2, 3.0, 4.x and 5.0.2), and with real data from a Landis-Gyr and Kaifa DSMR 4.2 electricity meters, in some cases with a slave gas meter connected. This code is open-source under the Apache 2.0 licence.


## Hardware specification

The DSMR P1-port uses an RJ12 (6P6C) [modular connector](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Modular_connector), which has 6 pins:

   1. Vcc: +5V power supply, max. 250 mA continuous (DSMR >= 4.0)
   2. RTS: data request, connect to +5V (4.0 - 5.5 V) to request data, connect to 0V/GND to stop data transmission
   3. GND: data ground
   4. NC: not connected
   5. TXD: data line (open collector output, logically inverted 5V serial signal, 8N1, 115200 baud for DSMR >= 4.0, 9600 baud for DSMR < 4.0)
   6. VccGND: power ground (DSMR >= 4.0)

All P1-pins are galvanically isolated from mains through an opto-coupler, and have over-voltage protection.
The data-line is an open-collector serial line output, which means that the signal is inverted relative to a normal serial line, and that it requires a pull-up resistor (1 - 10 kOhm) to be connected between RXD (pin 5) and the serial voltage required (for +5V you can connect it to Vcc / pin 1 or RTS / pin 2 on the P1-port). 

If RTS is set to HIGH, an ASCII text-based data-packet called a "telegram" is sent by the smart meter, either every 10 seconds (DSMR < 5.0) or every second (DSMR >= 5.0). The format of the telegrams is derived from the [IEC 62056-61](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/IEC_62056) standard for exchanging data with utility meters.


## Hardware setup

There are [roughly three ways](http://domoticx.com/p1-poort-slimme-meter-uitlezen-hardware/) to connect the P1-port to a computing device:

   - Directly to a 5V or 3.3V TTL serial interface (e.g. the one on a Raspberry Pi), using a transistor (e.g. BC547) and some resistors (e.g. 1 kOhm and/or 10 kOhm) to invert the signal and to pull it up to the required voltage. There are some possible  schematics [here](http://www.uploadarchief.net/files/download/p1%20smartmeter%20interface.gif), [here](http://tinypic.com/view.php?pic=10cum15&s=9#.XAad4BBRdD8) and [here](http://joostverberk.nl/images/LG350P1.PNG).
   - Directly to a TTL serial interface using an inverter IC (e.g. a [SN7404](http://www.ti.com/product/sn7404)) to invert the signal, as shown in [this example](https://tweakers.net/ext/f/aWGFHpcLoa1bN6KxMARGtNRk/full.jpg).
   - Using an RS232-port (or a USB-RS232-converter) and a pull-up resistor. This is often the easiest solution, as this can be done without soldering, cheap USB RS232-converters are easy to find and you can add as many interfaces as you need (e.g. using multiple USB-devices or even a 4-port device based on an [MCS7840](https://www.asix.com.tw/products.php?op=pItemdetail&PItemID=260;74;109&PLine=74) quad serial controller). The RS232 serial standard and the P1 standard both use an inverted serial signal, and altough the LOW voltage levels are technically incompatible (-15V to -3V for RS232, 0V to 1V for P1), most RS232-interfaces accept 0V as LOW and are able to decode the data transmitted by the P1-port without any problems. Just connect the signal ground of the two interfaces, and connect TXD on the P1-port to RXD on the RS232-interface. You will also still need to connect a 1-10 kOhm pull-up resistor between Vcc and the data line, and connect RTS on the P1-port to Vcc.

You can also get a prefabricated P1 to USB cable (easily ordered online, e.g. from [SOS Solutions](https://www.sossolutions.nl/slimme-meter-kabel), [slimmemeterkabel.nl](https://www.slimmemeterkabel.nl/), [Sinforcon](https://sinforcon999.aliexpress.com/store/group/TTL-RJ-series/401907_258809895.html?spm=a2g0z.12010108.0.0.57c86a08lGHrqB) or [Oloey](https://aliexpress.com/store/group/USB-TTL-Cable/4500072_514143826.html?spm=a2g0z.12010615.0.0.393072acMeJif8)). So far, every USB RS232-converter I tested worked, and most Linux-kernels support the more common converter chips out-of-the-box, and will make the data available on the `/dev/ttyUSB0` serial device. 

If you build your own cable, it's easiest to connect pins 1 and 2 of the P1-interface together, and to connect a 1-10 kOhm pull-up resistor between either of these and pin 5 (TXD). Then simply connect RXD of your serial interface to TXD on the P1-port, and connect the data ground on both interfaces. Cables can be made without soldering, e.g. by using [Wago 221-412 splicing connectors](https://www.wago.com/global/installation-terminal-blocks-and-connectors/compact-splicing-connectors/p/221-412). I've used a [4-port USB-interface](https://aliexpress.com/item/9pin-RS232-USB-2-0-to-4-ports-Serial-DB9-COM-Controller-Connectors-Adapter-Hub-K400Y/32829639400.html) with these [DB9 female terminal block connectors](https://aliexpress.com/item/High-Quality-DB9-RS232-Serial-Female-Adapter-Plate-to-9-Position-Terminal-Connector-Black-Green-Yellow/32738009438.html) to read up to four meters at once. I made the cables using [three-pair UTP-cable](https://nl.farnell.com/pro-power/cbbr0104/cable-cw1308-3pair-100m/dp/147770) and [RJ12-connectors](https://nl.farnell.com/lumberg/p-128/modular-plug-crimp-rj12-6p6c/dp/1243235), with a [1 kOhm pull-up resistor](https://nl.farnell.com/multicomp/mcf-0-25w-1k/res-1k-5-250mw-axial-carbon-film/dp/9339051) and several [splicing connectors](https://nl.farnell.com/wago/221-412/compact-splicing-connector-2pos/dp/2534732) neatly packed away in a [small junction box](https://nl.farnell.com/spelsberg/334-904-01/box-junction-56x40x23mm-ip20/dp/1615342). 

By default, the software echoes P1-telegrams back to the serial interface, so you can connect other devices that also read P1-data. If you're using RS232, you will need to convert the ca. 15V signal on the TXD-pin to 5V (e.g. using a [L7805 linear converter](https://nl.farnell.com/stmicroelectronics/l7805acv/ic-v-reg-5-0v-7805-to-220-3/dp/1087086)), before handing it on to another device. If you're using a TTL serial interface, you will need to invert the TXD signal using a transistor or inverter IC. Especially if you're using a 3.3V serial interface, it's probably easiest to use an inverter IC with an open collector output, such as the [SN7406](http://www.ti.com/product/sn7406), or an NPN-transistor to invert the signal and create an [open collector output](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Open_collector).

## Software setup

To test if data is coming in and the signal is inverted correctly, just compile and run the test program, and check if it sees any valid telegrams. 

On Raspbian and some other systems, you may have to install a C-compiler to compile the parser and the test program, e.g. `sudo apt-get install build-essential`. You may also have to install Ragel: `sudo apt-get install ragel`. Then clone the git-repository, compile the test program and run it:

```
git clone https://github.com/lvzon/dsmr-p1-parser.git
cd dsmr-p1-parser
./make.sh
./p1-test /dev/ttyUSB0 errors.dat
```

If valid telegrams are coming in, you should see something like this within about 10 seconds:

```

Possible telegram end at offset 624

```

If you get an error, check if the serial converter is connected and you're using the the correct serial device (depending on yoyur setup it can also be `/dev/ttyAMA0`, `/dev/ttyS0`, `/dev/ttyUSB1` or something else, check `dmesg` to be sure). If no valid telegram is seen within 25 seconds or so, hit `CTRL-C` and check `errors.dat`. The program tries to autodetect the baud rate, so if `errors.dat` contains garbage, you probably forgot to invert the signal, or you're inverting it twice. If `errors.dat` is empty, try dumping the serial device data directly (e.g. `cat /dev/ttyUSB1`). If no data comes in, check your cable connections and especially check if your data-line and ground and pull-up resistor are all connected correctly and the request-pin 2 is connected to at least +4V (and at most 5.5V). 

If the cable-length is more than a few metres, this can cause the voltages to drop below 4 V, so you may need to measure this and either use a better cable or connect the pull-up resistor and Vcc-RTS at the P1-side rather than at the serial interface. Also note that older (DSMR 2.x or 3.x) metres do not have a 5V Vcc pin, so in this case you'll need to supply 5V or 3.3V from another source.

## Transmitting data

The `packmsg`-branch contains an experimental application that reads telegrams from a serial device and echoes the telegrams back to the interface. Telegram data is parsed, and energy, power and gas data is sent directly to a server socket, using a very compact encoding based on [MessagePack](https://msgpack.org/). This application is functional but still under development, I use it in a pilot project to collect and act upon smart meter data in real time. I will try to include an example server and more documentation soon.

## TODO

   - Include packmsg-server example (Python code).
   - Document p1-lib data structure and functions.
   - Test with more meters.
   - Adapt the parser for use on non-POSIX microcontroller platforms.
   
   
## Other resources

I wrote this parser for use at [LENS](http://lens-energie.nl/), because I needed something that was light-weight and complete, and there currently does not seem to be another full DSMR P1 telegram-parser that is open-source and can be used in regular C programs. However, there are many parsers in many other programming languages:
